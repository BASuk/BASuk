## 👋 Hi, I'm Ben Smith

Welcome to my GitHub!

I’m a **data analyst at the Department for Education (DfE)**, specialising in **schools data and analysis**. My strongest tools are **R** and **SQL**, which I use to build robust, automated pipelines that ensure high-quality, reproducible outputs. I also work with **Python** and the **Power Platform** (Power BI, Power Automate, Power Apps) to streamline workflows and enhance productivity.

### 🛠️ What I Do
- 📈 Build and maintain **R-based data pipelines** for analysis and reporting  
- 🧮 Use **SQL** to wrangle and query complex datasets  
- 🐍 Expand my capabilities with **Python** for automation and integration  
- ⚙️ Leverage **Power Platform tools** to connect systems and automate tasks  

### 🏡 At Home
Outside of work, I’m just as hands-on:
- 🏠 Automating my home with **Home Assistant**, using a mix of custom and off-the-shelf sensors  
- 🗣️ Replacing Google and Alexa devices with **Home Assistant** and **Ollama** for local voice control  
- 🎥 Running a self-hosted stack including **Frigate**, **TrueNAS**, **Immich**, **Jellyfin**, and **Nextcloud**  
- 🌳 Developing a system to **automate fruit tree maintenance** with sensors and smart watering  
- 🧩 Tinkering, repairing, and gaming on PC  
- 👨‍👧‍👦 Raising four wonderful kids  

### 🎯 Goals
- Deepen my **Python** skills  
- Share useful tools, scripts, and automations  
- Connect with others who love data, DIY tech, and smart systems
